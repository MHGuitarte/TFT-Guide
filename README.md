# TFT-Guide
Electron based app for TeamFight Tactics. API used is Google Firestore. Project focused on learning both techs.

This version of TFT-Guide is a recovery of a failed project started before. I saved what I could and made a few changes to the app.

Besides, this time I used Electron-Forge to set up the project.

I would like to repeat that this project is just for learning purposes,even if I end up making a whole application out of this.
